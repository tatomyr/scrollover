# scrollover
Microlibrary for scrolling over whole-page slides.

Mark slides with `data-scrollover` & set time you want to slide over (in milliseconds) within launched script with `data-scrollover-time`.

Be aware that you should avoid any margins at the edges of the slides. This concerns also inner elements like `<h1>` tags.

See the example of using this library in `index.html` file.
